#' Line segments with flexible arrows
#'
#' `geom_arrowsegment()` is parameterised much as [geom_segment()], and the default
#' `geom_arrowsegment()` is equivalent to `geom_segment(arrow = arrow())`. (It is
#' assumed that the user wants some kind of arrow.) The extended functionality is to
#' allow free placement of the arrowhead anywhere along the segment, and also multiple
#' arrowheads, and to allow a fill aesthetic (which will only be visible for closed
#' arrowheads).
#'
#' The function works by dividing the line up into 1 or more segment grobs, each of
#' which is generated by [grid::arrow()] except potentially the last (the closest
#' to the point (`xend`, `yend'`). The vector `arrow_positions`, whose entries must
#' lie between 0 and 1, defines where each arrow segment ends, as a proportional
#' position along the line. If the last entry of `arrow_positions` 1, then the last
#' grob has an arrow; otherwise it does not.
#'
#' The function is designed with the expectation that arrows point from (`x`,`y`) to
#' (`xend`,`yend`) but the `arrows` argument will happily accept `arrow(ends = "first")`
#' or `arrow(ends = "both")` if you prefer. Just remember that the final segment is
#' only an arrow at all if the last entry of `arrow_positions` is 1.
#'
#' @inheritParams ggplot2::layer
#' @inheritParams ggplot2::geom_segment
#' @param arrow_positions A vector of distinct points on the unit interval. 0 is not
#' permitted but arbitrarily small values are; 1 is permitted. The default behaviour is that
#' arrowheads will be placed proportionally along the line connecting (`x`,`y`)
#' to (`xend`,`yend`) at these points.
#' In more detail: The first arrow segment begins at (`x`,`y`) and ends a proportional
#' distance along the straight line joining (`x`,`y`) and(`xend`,`yend`) equal to the first
#' entry of this vector. The second bridges the first two entries, and so on. If the final
#' entry is 1 then the last segment is an arrow (and hence usually an arrowhead will be
#' placed at the end of the line). If it is not, then  the last segment is simply a line.
#' These will be sorted into order from 0 to 1 if they are not already.
#' @param arrows Either an arrow generated by [grid::arrow()] of a list of such arrows. In
#' the former case or if the list has length 1, the arrowhead so de defined is used every
#' time; otherwise the list is expected to have the same length as
#' `arrow_positions` and each segment defined by that argument is ended by the respective
#' element of this one. The default is [grid::arrow()] with default parameters.
#' @param arrow_fills A vector of fill colours for the arrowheads, behaves as
#' the `arrow_fill` option in [`geom_segment`]. This will overrule a fill aesthetic in
#' the same way that specifying a single `fill` outside `aes` specification will.
